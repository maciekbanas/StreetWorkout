# WorkoutApp

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is an experimental app to measure physical activity progress in
calisthenics.

The app does not come with any specific training program (at least for
the time being). It is rather a tool to measure single training units
and gather data about them in time.

Basic idea is to leave workout routine as flexible to user as possible,
i.e.Â user may measure his workout (number series and reps) for a given
time, without any specific training program being imposed.
